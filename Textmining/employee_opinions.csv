2;They will have to burn the building down before I will leave...and even then, I may just work in the ashes.;positive

4;This is the second love of my life.;positive
5;I have been an employee here for 45 years and will stay to my last moments.;positive
6;For personal reasons I have been forced to seek employment in another state, and will probably need to leave. This makes me incredibly sad, as it really is the best place to work. After many interviews, I can already see that other companies will not have nearly the same benefits and culture as my company. Even my management, when I told them that I needed to start looking elsewhere, were happy to offer whatever assistance they could in helping me. They are even considering opening a new branch office in the city where I need to go. How much better can a company be??;positive

14;This office is without question closer than some families.;positive
15;There is never a day that goes by without at least one senior manager asking me how I am doing. That in itself is awesome!;positive
16;I have been with my company for 20 years. Most of my coworkers in my immediate group have been here 10-30 years! The tenure is long because we work for a company that appreciates us and rewards us daily both in the type of work that we do and the benefits and pay we receive.;positive
17;I cannot think of a better, more efficiently-run company to work for. I have been here 25 years and every year has been awesome!!!;positive

19;I have a lot of friends that have gone to other organizations thinking the grass is always greener.

27;I want out.;negative
